## Introduction
This code is a simple chatbot(suzu_bot) that uses OpenAI's language generation API to generate responses based on user input. The user can interact with the chatbot through voice commands using the Speech Recognition and Pyttsx3 libraries.

## Libraries used
- OpenAI: An AI research organization that provides access to a variety of powerful AI models via APIs.
- Speech Recognition: A library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs.
- Pyttsx3: A Python library for converting text to speech.

## Getting an OpenAI API Key
1. Sign up for an OpenAI account at https://beta.openai.com/signup.

2. Verify your email address and log in to your OpenAI account.

3. Generate an API Key by navigating to the API Keys section in your account settings.

## How to use
1. Install the required libraries by running the following command in your terminal: 

```pip3 install openai speech_recognition pyttsx3```


2. Set your OpenAI API key in the code.

3. Run the code using the following command: 

```python suzu_bot.py```


4. The chatbot will ask for voice input using the text "Speak:". Speak your query after the prompt.

5. The chatbot will respond with a text and audio response.

6. Repeat the process as many times as desired. The chatbot will continue to listen for voice commands until you say "bye".

## Code structure
- The code sets the OpenAI API key.
- The `chatbot` function takes in a prompt and returns a response generated by OpenAI's language generation API.
- The `get_audio_input` function listens for voice input and converts it to text.
- The `play_audio_output` function converts text to speech and plays it back.
- The main loop of the code continues to listen for voice input and respond with the chatbot's generated response until the user says "bye".
